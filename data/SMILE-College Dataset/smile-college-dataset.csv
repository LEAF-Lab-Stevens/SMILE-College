0,University of Washington,i think there needs to be an expansion. one quarter of counseling is not enough to develop a relationship with a therapist. ,DISSATISFIED
1,Haverford College,not too sure. don't have a ton of exposure to on campus counseling ,NEUTRAL
2,University of Washington,i have looked at group counseling but they are still remote. i am tired of remote and don't want it simple because it's remote. if it were in person i would definitely go to group therapy.,DISSATISFIED
3,Barnard,"not much in my opinion i’d working well. i think the diversity needs to increase for the counselors available, there really needs to be an increase in counselors too since scheduling is so limited and it could take weeks to get an appointment.",DISSATISFIED
4,El Camino Community College District,"the group sessions for stress relief and meditation has worked great for me.
i believe more individual telehealth options would be great",SATISFIED
5,Arizona State,"i am a fully online student and i wish i was able to use more telehealth services
",DISSATISFIED
6,Wellesley,"access to counselors is simple (from my experience), but more counselors are needed for general outreach before students are in crisis.",MIXED
7,UMich,the counseling center is just burdened with the amount of students that need help. it's simply the volume of students that need help. the services aren't even that bad if they were just able to reach more people. ,DISSATISFIED
8,Barnard,"i believe that for many, the addition of having 6 1 hour therapy sessions is helpful for short term help",SATISFIED
9,Willamette,"many students base assumptions on all staff based off of how we interact with the more common employees. everyone who works at the front desk is very polite and helpful. but me and many of my (typically female-identifying) peers have felt unsafe, judged, and nervous around and with the nurses in bishop wellness center. they tell you rudely all of the things you could have done to avoid this problem rather than assisting us with the problem now.

10,Rowan,i have used the resources at the wellness center for my mental health even before the pandemic and i think it needs help especially sense what happened last semester ,DISSATISFIED

14,Florida International University,our therapists need to be more responsible and make more of an effort to reach out to their patients ,DISSATISFIED
15,CU Boulder,"i would not describe any of it as working well. tedium and bureaucracy abound. six complementary sessions with a provider per academic year isn't enough. general poor communication/knowledge of what's available. met with a case manager once who quit or retired (unclear which) before a second meeting so i had to do the bulk of the intake stuff again. that case manager referred me to services that a therapist providing services through caps didn't know about. all this said, it's not clear to me if these problems are unique to my college, because as best i can tell nobody working in mental health has a good picture of the field.

16,Arizona State,they do a good job providing training with where to access and how to provide service.,SATISFIED
17,Virginia,"well: constantly reminding students of caps, focus on students with poor mental health, lots of opportunities to seek help
poor: limited focus on maintaining good mental health in students",MIXED
18,New York University,"what’s working wel is they’re heavily connected with external sources. however, i do think they need to hire more psychiatrists so that people can quickly go through real treatment and be prescribed medication. ",MIXED
19,Temple,"last semester, there was a time where dogs were brought to the library to de-stress around finals. i thought it was nice, but there should be things open for the entire semester/year and be open for everyone, without anything possibly restricting them, such as a dog allergy ",MIXED
20,Mt Holyoke,able to register for a counseling session and get an appt within 7-10 days,SATISFIED

23,University of Wisconsin-River Falls,i think there are some good options but they are not advertised well at all,MIXED
24,Arizona State,"i haven't went to mental-health counseling because i take care of my mental health alone majority of the time, but i would say depression and anxiety are some major aspects of mental health that needs more attention that it already has.",NEUTRAL
25,University of Minnesota,i feel like the college in general is lacking. they advertise they care but i don’t feel like it’s genuine.,DISSATISFIED
26,New York University,i think it’s a great start to have free sessions but there shouldn’t be a cap,DISSATISFIED
27,Arizona State,unfortunately i am not using any of the mental health/wellness services provided.,NEUTRAL
28,USC,"though i have never attended, i appreciate the let's talk drop-in sessions available through my school. what might need more attention is the availability of counseling sessions, as i remember when i tried to make an appointment back in 2020 there were none available.",MIXED
29,Ohio State,"osu’s counseling and consultation services is a complete mess. it is advertised as a therapy option, yet students in crisis aren’t able to get in for months, and the help is near useless",DISSATISFIED

40,Georgia,"i'm not sure what mental health or wellness services/supports are provided by my college but in general, i've heard that the quality of such services (mental health/wellness) isn't very good quality nor long-lasting. i think the overall sector of it in uga has to be improved and more funded.",DISSATISFIED

42,Trident Technical College,i have not seen anything about them having any mental health help. ,DISSATISFIED
43,UCLA,i think the triage needs more attention. it seems excessive to wait at least 45 minutes to get help. but their referral plan has excellent rates if you have school insurance. ,MIXED

45,UCLA,"the caps center and black bruin center is working well at ucla to help support students with resources, activities, and counselors regarding mental health.",SATISFIED

47,University of New Mexico-Main Campus,i think my college is doing alright when it comes to mental health wellness.,SATISFIED
48,San Joaquin Delta College,counseling as in just hearing about what student had to say really worked well for me personally,SATISFIED
49,Arizona State,they shouldn’t set limits on how many weeks you can see a counselor just cuz staff is limited.,DISSATISFIED
50,Texas A&M,"an aspect of mental health that needs improvement is that mentally ill people sometimes aren’t aware that they are unwell, and may not even consider they need help. others that are aware are presented with hindrance stressors, like jumping through a bunch of hoops just to schedule an appointment. it was through a conversation with my advisor (which took me weeks to meet with because i was avoidant) to get an appointment scheduled with someone at sas. i thought they were my counselor, but they only sent me resources to contact a counselor. which is better than nothing. i do not want to complain. 

i do plan on meeting with a counselor because i’m willing to do whatever at this point to get out of this point of my life, however i don’t feel like making an appointment. i haven’t been able to complete my coursework; why would i prioritize scheduling appointments with counselors? 

so i feel as if the campus community could benefit from easy access to a counselor. i think every human being needs to attend counseling, anyways. the challenge would be to make it not too easy to schedule, otherwise it might be overused, and inefficient. ",DISSATISFIED

57,Siena College,i am not sure. i don’t feel like i am getting any help with my mental health,DISSATISFIED
58,Florida International University,the counseling on-campus helps students out everyday. fiu should focus more on online counseling because the pandemic forces students to stay home,MIXED
59,Arizona State,"i’m an online student, and i haven’t heard too much about many mental health services offered. i don’t know if it’s because i am an online student and it just isn’t as available to online students compared to on-campus students, but i think there should be options to have video appointments, and maybe have those professionals be able to look into referrals to professionals in that student’s area, so they can receive local help as well.

62,Arizona State,i have not attempted to use any mental health resource because i am primarily an online student ,NEUTRAL
63,MIT,"the fact that i know multiple people who were told they needed more support than mit could provide and then just completely ghosted is absolutely abhorrent. if someone so desperately needs help that the counseling services at the school aren't able to provide it, they absolutely should be doing everything in their power to connect that person with off campus resources that can help them immediately.

64,Binghamton,"there seem to be many services, but many of the people running them are students who aren't sure of what they're doing.",DISSATISFIED
65,Wellesley,i feel as if there desperately needs to be more diversity on the counselling team as well as more response to student input. i feel like certain counsellors (jan park) are very harmful to students and simply need to be checked. i think the college does a good job of providing a little bit to everyone but this spreads it thin.,DISSATISFIED
66,Youngstown State University,none really if you reach out to counseling and have problems that can’t be fixed in 2 talks you are told you have to many problems and no one is going to have problems that can be fixed fast if you are going for depression or anxiety bc that’s just not how it works,DISSATISFIED

72,UMass Amherst,"most of my experiences with these services were in 2019, when i was really struggling with depression and anxiety. i was told that there weren't enough resources to really help me, and to try and find a therapist off campus. i feel as though umass does a great job advertising, but it's hard to know that you'll get actual support when you need it",DISSATISFIED

78,LSU,"i think the school at least has some sort of staff that can help students, but i'm very hesitant to ever use those resources since of all the bad things i have heard about it. i've heard that the staff isn't very attentive and doesn't really listen to students/clients and people's experiences just overall haven't sounded that good. there's a quantity of resources, but it seems like the quality of those resources isn't actually that helpful for those who are struggling.",DISSATISFIED

80,CU Boulder,cu’s mental health “department” is a shit show. they don’t care about students. they made a promise to bring on 20 new providers and actually fired 10 existing ones instead. when i reached my lowest low i asked for therapy twice a week instead of once and they discontinued my care entirely because of the request. the director did a coverup job and tried to conceal my health records that i am legally obligated to. it took two months for me to finally have all of my health documents in my possession and i had to use a third party to force her to give me the information i was entitled to. ,DISSATISFIED

102,Duke,"counselors need to be more diverse, as i've already mentioned.
my visits to caps in fall 2019 were practically useless although i was on the brink of a mental health disaster in my life. thankfully, i fixed my problems with the help of friends, family, and even strangers over the semester i took off in fall 2020. this was only because those people truly understood my non-generic problems and were willing to give me time. they were willing to walk alongside me with my every day activities.

maybe matching students who can help each other and both can actually give time of the day to each other might be also a good solution.

another essential is having more counselors. i think being told to come back 14 days later is an absolute red flag. ",DISSATISFIED

109,Oswego,the counseling center is way over booked. students either can’t get an appointment or they only get like one or two each semester. this is something that many people need consistency with. the college needs more funding so that they can hire additional mental health counselors and therapists.,DISSATISFIED
