0,Texas A&M,"An aspect of mental health that needs improvement is that mentally ill people sometimes aren’t aware that they are unwell, and may not even consider they need help. Others that are aware are presented with hindrance stressors, like jumping through a bunch of hoops just to schedule an appointment. It was through a conversation with my advisor (which took me weeks to meet with because I was avoidant) to get an appointment scheduled with someone at SAS. I thought they were my counselor, but they only sent me resources to contact a counselor. Which is better than nothing. I do not want to complain. 

I do plan on meeting with a counselor because I’m willing to do whatever at this point to get out of this point of my life, however I don’t feel like making an appointment. I haven’t been able to complete my coursework; why would I prioritize scheduling appointments with counselors? 

So I feel as if the campus community could benefit from easy access to a counselor. I think every human being needs to attend counseling, anyways. The challenge would be to make it not too easy to schedule, otherwise it might be overused, and inefficient. "
1,Smith,"The therapists themselves are ok - although niche. I mean they work well for some. There’s not much diversity- and I know that smith says half are POC but when the total is 12, 50% of employees are still just 6. We need more therapists. It’s clear and fact that Smith students carry more trauma than other students (and that’s just starting from identity) so it’s a no brainer that 12 isn’t enough. Especially with an over enrolled school - we didn’t have enough therapists before and now we certainly don’t have enough. We took a mental health survey earlier that is apparently still being analyzed and I look at data all day. I’d be blind to still wonder if we need more therapists (especially when the weight of not having enough therapists can result in death)"
2,Johns Hopkins University,"Not nearly enough counselors or therapists, and they often just try to refer people outside of the counseling center. They make it pretty difficult to get signed up in the first place. They only want to do short term counseling before outsourcing people. I know a lot of people who just didn't like the staff as well and said they didn't take them super seriously. Also they only want to meet every two weeks. 

At least they provide it for free. Some people really like their counselors as well. I like mine. I'm lucky I only need some minimal talking and that I'm graduating otherwise I'd have been sent away as well which is such a mission to set up and probably expensive or a lot of work to set up with insurance. "
3,Duke,"Counselors need to be more diverse, as I've already mentioned.
My visits to CAPS in Fall 2019 were practically useless although I was on the brink of a mental health disaster in my life. Thankfully, I fixed my problems with the help of friends, family, and even strangers over the semester I took off in Fall 2020. This was only because those people truly understood my non-generic problems and were willing to give me time. They were willing to walk alongside me with my every day activities.

Maybe matching students who can help each other and both can actually give time of the day to each other might be also a good solution.

Another essential is having more counselors. I think being told to come back 14 days later is an absolute red flag. "
4,CU Boulder,"It is easy to get in contact with mental health services, but recently when I was going through a little crisis I called and did not get much help and it seemed like they got anxious and didn’t know what to do or say and kind of went super textbook with responding to me like explaining to me how anxiety works and I was like I know I have it and just not really helping. Another time freshman year I went to caps for help finding a therapist and they really didn’t give me many options that worked with my insurance so I took matters into my own hands and went through my insurance which was way easier and i found so many options"
5,Wellesley,"I don't really feel like too much is going well?? I have an off-campus therapist who I've been seeing since before I started college, but prior to the pandemic found myself looking for a closer therapist; Wellesley's services weren't helpful, and often bureaucratic. My psychiatrist who I saw all through high school passed during my sophomore year of college (fall 2020), leaving me without prescription access. Wellesley provided me a list of referrals, but I ended up having to contact my PCP to get a prescription to tide me over so that I would not be withdrawing from my medication. Overall..... I really think Wellesley needs to streamline the process of getting access to regular mental healthcare"
6,CU Boulder,CU’s mental health “department” is a shit show. They don’t care about students. They made a promise to bring on 20 new providers and actually fired 10 existing ones instead. When I reached my lowest low I asked for therapy twice a week instead of once and they discontinued my care entirely because of the request. The director did a coverup job and tried to conceal MY health records that I am legally obligated to. It took two months for me to finally have all of my health documents in my possession and I had to use a third party to force her to give me the information I was entitled to. 
7,CU Boulder,"I would not describe any of it as working well. Tedium and bureaucracy abound. Six complementary sessions with a provider per academic year isn't enough. General poor communication/knowledge of what's available. Met with a case manager once who quit or retired (unclear which) before a second meeting so I had to do the bulk of the intake stuff again. That case manager referred me to services that a therapist providing services through CAPS didn't know about. All this said, it's not clear to me if these problems are unique to my college, because as best I can tell nobody working in mental health has a good picture of the field. "
8,Haverford College,I think the main counseling service is helpful when you are able to get an appointment. I was on the waitlist for over a month and I know many other students have been waiting as well. I have been referred to a psychiatrist and there's a waiting list for that too. Mental Health is taken very seriously here but there are just not enough counselors for all the students. So there needs to be somewhere for someone to go when they are on the waiting list would be helpful. Even like a peer counseling service would be great. My high school had one and people used that often.
9,UC Davis,Once I was able to meet with a mental health counselor things looked better with my mental health. I was able to comfortably talk with my counselor and schedule regular sessions. My counselor also connected me to a case manager and through them I was able to find long-term therapy providers. I wish the Counseling center had more staff. It seems mental health concerns are more prominent in college and with the pandemic. The soonest I was able to see my counselor the first time was a few weeks out from when I scheduled it. But sometimes people need support that isn't necessarily a dire emergency. 
10,University of Arizona,"I think getting more people to focus ""living on the now"" would be very beneficial, a lot of my mental problems stem from either thinking too much of the past (friends I wished I stayed in touch with, social interaction I wished I acted differently in), or worrying too much about the future (what if I lose passion towards my major, what if some domino effect causes me to lose EVERYTHING I ever cherished in my life) (notice these unhelpful what-ifs), so getting the idea of get out of your head, stop overthinking, and just DO is something that has been helpful to me."
11,Lewis & Clark College,"I feel the college has notoriously let people down in regard to mental health services. It is difficult to receive ongoing counseling, many of the counselors that I've seen have been unfriendly or unhelpful, and it is extremely difficult to get a psychiatric diagnosis in order to receive accommodations. Above all, the majority of the counselors are white women, which makes it difficult to describe my experiences to them as a person of color and they often provide culture-blind strategies for dealing with problems. John Hancock has been the most helpful person to me, but he is unavailable for ongoing counseling appointments."
12,Illinois Valley Community College,"I'll be honest, I don't have time to take care of my mental health, so I don't. I'm stressed about the way the world is and this was before the pandemic even started. Ever since graduating high school, things have been different and way harder. Everything costs more, I finally get a job that can hold me over and I can afford to save up for my future and suddenly that's not good enough. Why raise the living wage if you're going to raise the prices of everything else? It leaves us back at square one and I can't afford jack anymore"
13,Lafayette College,"I think that it is really good that a lot of professors encourage and advertise mental health services available on campus. That being said, I only hear this at the beginning of the course and no other times afterwards. Furthermore, the resources for health services are only open on weekdays and it is so tedious to find where and how to schedule a time slot. And on top of that, I felt that the time when I went to visit the mental health center at the school, I felt that it lacked life and that I was talking to a robot."
14,UPenn,"CAPS short term counseling does not work that well. Some student could much benefit from a longer client-therapist relationship but don’t have the time, money, or knowledge of finding a therapist from outside the University. CAPS referral service also was terrible and didn’t help me. The quality of CAPS therapists were hit or miss—I’ve tried over 4 different people. The university also doesn’t prioritize student mental health in general, having a “wellness week” does nothing in comparison to actually having policies regarding attendance, longer and/or more frequent breaks, not letting professors assign work during breaks, etc. "
15,Rochester,"Counselors on campus are not experienced in the field. They are grad students who are not qualified to address extreme trauma such as sexual assault, domestic violence, and homelessness. I am also not comfortable with group/individual sessions being recorded and this have affected my ability to open up. There needs to be resources for long term therapy and better recommendations for therapists off campus. For context, I recieved NO help in finding a therapist off campus. There also needs to be flexible hours on weekends and evenings as students have classes during the day. "
16,Virginia,"We had two days for drop-in counseling where students signed up to meet with a counselor for 20 minute sessions. This helped me learn about some resources for myself. I don't have much experience with other mental health wellness services at my university, but I have heard from other students that there can be long wait times to meet with counselors and they're more a short-term solution (e.g., referring students to other therapists). There is a new telehealth counseling service which I don't know much about but it seems to address these problems."
17,Earlham College,"The psychiatric nurse practitioner is relatively accessible, which is good considering so many students have no access to healthcare outside of campus. Everything besides that needs more attention. There is no easy-to-find/access on-campus support for students who need to find a real therapist, which leads to these students receiving no mental healthcare because they have had such poor experiences with Counseling Services. Earlham needs someone who is dedicated to connecting students with in-network licensed therapists who they can continue to see during breaks and after graduation, ensuring continuity of care. "
18,New York University,"We have a 24-hour crisis hotline, which is a great resource with very little wait time (that I've experienced). However, probably about half the counselors employed at the student health center seem to be qualified for their jobs. Many seem to want you out of the office as quickly as possible rather than wanting to listen and help, and others are extremely oblivious to the realities of mental illness (i.e. a counselor telling me to ""just try harder"" to fall asleep when anxiety was keeping me up at night). "
19,Utah,"I don't know entirely what the full mental health services on campus are, but for me my biggest stressor right now is academics. I feel like school is so overwhelming I have had very little time for much else in life. I also feel like I am struggling with dating anxiety, that with rigorous academics and nearly two years of COVID isolation I don't know how to approach the opposite sex and engage in a relationship... which is frustrating since it seems to come naturally to my peers. "
20,Temple,"I haven't utilized the mental health services but I think that we should have more indirect services that support mental health. It can be less intimidating for students to go out to a mental health program that's beneficial to them than seeking a guidance counselor directly from my own personal experience. If there are resources, maybe they need a way to promote these better? A suggestion I have is to reach out to advisors of each college and ask for them to send out emails/announcements about these events."
21,Stony Brook University,"I have only utilized CAPS as a resource. I believe this has worked well due to how much I love my counselor. However, it took a while to get to her. Before this, I was placed with a counselor (who was a man when i asked for it not to be) who asked extremely invasive questions and was very misunderstanding. it warded me off from caps. i’ve also heard other people caps takes way too long to get back to them and doesn’t have enough room."
22,University of Wisconsin-Madison,"I have never explicitly used the services given by the college, although looking back there were points where I probably should've. I think more communication and general support from the university would go a long way, since there are probably others who have been in situations like mine. If I knew what services were available and how to receive them it would be easier to get them rather than having to do the research myself when I'm not sure what kind of help I want."
23,Arizona State,"The free counseling sucked, they need more faculty and especially more diverse faculty.  It got to a point where they were more focused on sending me to an off campus therapist than making sure I am taking care of myself and I dreaded talking to them.  They need to have an actual on-campus option.  I don't have a therapist because they're all so expensive and the on-campus staff is only really focused on short term rather than long term solutions."
24,University of Central Florida,"I love the space on the main campus, it's so welcoming and safe, it doesn't even feel like I'm on campus. I also like how many, not all, of the counselors, are licensed professionals, which gives me peace of mind. I think most students agree there needs to be more counselors or if not a good relationship with a network of counselors. Once you are in the system it's not bad to get an appointment, but the initial appointment is hard to get."
25,Cornell,"The university's approach to mental health has become a triage, turning permanent counseling services into temporary ones to aim to reduce suicides and severe mental health issues, at the cost of cutting long-term care to many students who relied on it. It's a backwards approach; the university needs to funnel a massive increase in funding to its on-campus counseling and restore its old system, as there are many students who feel they have nowhere to go anymore for mental health assistance. "
26,LSU,"I think the school at least has some sort of staff that can help students, but I'm very hesitant to ever use those resources since of all the bad things I have heard about it. I've heard that the staff isn't very attentive and doesn't really listen to students/clients and people's experiences just overall haven't sounded that good. There's a quantity of resources, but it seems like the quality of those resources isn't actually that helpful for those who are struggling."
27,Arizona State,"I don’t know what services are working well because I personally am unaware of the ones we do have. I think aspects that need more attention are those for students who are first generation. Ideas like imposter syndrome play a huge factor. You feel you don’t belong, no one relates, you’re unsure what job you’ll get outside of job, if any at all. I think there should also be more advising on helping students create plans for after college. "
28,Housatonic Community College,"The aspects of the mental health and wellness that need more attention are more professional counselors that can attend to the students who would like to make an appointment to discuss their mental health. Right now there are only 2-3 counselors available that attend to the 3,000 students on campus which sounds stressful enough as it is and having more counselors at the school, regardless of what race or gender a counselor is, will be beneficial to the students. "
29,Willamette,"Many students base assumptions on all staff based off of how we interact with the more common employees. Everyone who works at the front desk is very polite and helpful. But me and many of my (typically female-identifying) peers have felt unsafe, judged, and nervous around and with the nurses in Bishop Wellness center. They tell you rudely all of the things you could have done to avoid this problem rather than assisting us with the problem now. "
30,UMich,"They do have counseling services, however they are hard to access. Most professors are pretty welcoming but I think that if mental health days off were offered in the syllabi of classes that it would better to prioritize mental health. Given the esteem of the university, there is a lot of pressure to thrive and a lot of pressure to compete with your peers, helping to reduce that pressure would also be helpful for a lot of students. "
31,Arizona State,"I’m an online student, and I haven’t heard too much about many mental health services offered. I don’t know if it’s because I am an online student and it just isn’t as available to online students compared to on-campus students, but I think there should be options to have video appointments, and maybe have those professionals be able to look into referrals to professionals in that student’s area, so they can receive local help as well. "
32,Arizona State,I do not really know as I have not utilized this service from ASU. I do however know that ASU does a good job at advertising Counseling as an option for students. I have had several friends talk to me about their experiences with ASU counseling and that it is lackluster and they redirected them to people outside of the campus. It would be nice if they were trained to be able to deal with all issues.
33,UTK,"I seek mental health help with an off-campus therapist and am not very familiar with the inner workings of UT's on campus therapy/supports. I do think there needs to be more classroom/workload support for students struggling with their mental health. My biggest stressors and struggles are often directly related to my classwork and ability to succeed in class, and it feels like there is no support for those struggles that translates directly to classes and workload. "
34,Arizona State,"I feel as though we are told we have them which is great about telling us it is there, but does not give specifics about what they do, how they help. They seem as though it's like high school counselors, who can't help other than tell you ""it's okay, you'll get through it."" I've been told multiple times the ASU counselors not good compared to an actual therapist and that's why I have never gone. "
35,University of Minnesota,I think the clubs on campus are a great way to meet new people with similar interests and do something you enjoy together. Participating in things like clubs does wonders for the brain because it gives you something to look forward to and have fun with outside of classes. I think clubs in general need more attention and support from the university since they are places where most students meet and make friends on campus. 
36,Brigham Young University-Provo,"I think it is great that we have CAPS, and I know lots of students use that services. I'm not sure how it is recently, but I know in the past it was nearly impossible to get an appointment, especially last minute. I think it is really great that we have a coordinator who can help students find off campus care and I wish that more people were open to that kind of thing. "
37,Arizona State,"I'm cynical about finding a therapist who can actually help. Too many therapists, whether they are PhDs, MDs or social workers, just come off as glorified cheerleaders. I need an intelligent, insightful therapist, and I no longer believe I can find one. I haven't given my college a chance to help me because I kind of have the opposite of a placebo effect--I no longer believe any therapist or any drug can help me."
38,Brigham Young University-Provo,"It is widely known that if you need to see a counselor, it will take at least weeks to get you in if not a month or so. I think this is a big failing and students should be able to get support right away. You can always go to the CAPS office at any point for a one time visit but that is also hard to schedule and not widely advertised."
39,Purdue University-Main Campus,"I like how they promote the services, but the CAPS system isn't great. I have to call them, and I can never find a place to call them alone, meaning I have to call while around other people, which is very stressful. I wish they would accept emails or forms to register instead, as I don't feel comfortable telling the people around me that I need help with my mental health."
40,UMass Amherst,"Considering I haven’t used them very much but the few experiences I’ve had with it it’s been fairly ok. Mainly going through zoom calls and such but I feel a bit disconnected when doing it through this. And yes I know that due to the pandemic these services needed to be done through that, I just don’t feel online resources are the way to go at least for me. "
41,Cornell College,"I would consider our mental health facilities to be significantly lacking, although we have counselors they are just that, they don’t meet a lot of the requirements that college students need to win they are struggling severely with multiple mental health issues. One of the biggest things with that is that we only have three free visits a year and that is inadequate to any mental health needs"
42,Sewanee-The University of the South,"In general, there's lots of availability for individual counseling for mild mental illness, but trying to get help for particular issues is difficult because we aren't given bios for therapists. (We also aren't able to choose who we see.) I've already gone through several therapists because it hasn't been made clear to me that they don't specialize in what I need help with until a few sessions in."
43,Arizona State,"I am an online student living near Chicago. Aside from student-run groups and clubs, there doesn't seem to be as many options for online students who are in need of mental health and wellness services. I think that the school should increase the amount of options available to online students, and make an effort to clearly communicate those options to students so that they know there are options."
44,Northwestern,"I think it’s great that we have CAPS, but I don’t think that it’s big enough to service everyone who would benefit from it.  I’ve heard from many people that they waited months to get an initial appointment, which has caused me to skip that resource entirely and search for off campus options.  I’m lucky to have that option, but I know many students don’t."
45,University of Minnesota,"I have a few friends who have regular or semi-regular counseling meetings. They seem very grateful to have those sessions and look forward to the days they can talk things out with a professional on campus. I guess as someone who is interested in starting counseling, I don’t know where to begin so that may be something they could communicate more to both new and attending students."
46,MIT,"The fact that I know multiple people who were told they needed more support than MIT could provide and then just completely ghosted is absolutely abhorrent. If someone so desperately needs help that the counseling services at the school aren't able to provide it, they absolutely should be doing everything in their power to connect that person with off campus resources that can help them immediately. "
47,Arizona State,"I haven't really accessed the mental health/wellness services because the only ones I really know about are counseling. That costs money and I can already hardly afford college as is, so I never sought it out. But in terms of what may need more attention, I feel that students could benefit from boosting their self-worth/self-respect. I'm not sure what could be implemented to do that though."
48,IU,"I don't think any of it is working ""well."" IU needs more counselors and psychiatrists and BETTER counselors and psychiatrists. If you are only going to offer help for those struggling on average low mental health rather than those struggling with real mental illnesses, say that. They need to have people on staff that can diagnose and actually help those with personality disorders, schizophrenia,  etc."
49,University of Arizona,"I don't think I've experienced much of what UA has to offer in regard to mental health. As a part of TRIO, I do get asked and checked on but I wouldn't really consider it a mental health service. I think I see more aspects of stress and depression but I rarely ever see aspects of procrastination or lack of motivation in regards to mental health."
50,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,"None.  The only thing I found helpful is that my professors were extremely understanding and very willing to help.  The university focuses on immediate problems and does not help support students with mental health issues long term.  the mental health services are abysmal and provide a one-size-fits-all approach to treating the wide variety in depression, anxiety, etc. experienced by students campus wide."
51,Bates College,"there is a counseling center with a few therapists, a psychiatrist, and a nurse practitioner. two of the therapists are white men, one is a black woman, and the rest are all white women. i see one of the white male therapists (because he is queer identifying and so am i - he’s the only queer identifying therapist). we definitely need more diverse staff. "
52,UMass Amherst,"Most of my experiences with these services were in 2019, when I was really struggling with depression and anxiety. I was told that there weren't enough resources to really help me, and to try and find a therapist off campus. I feel as though UMass does a great job advertising, but it's hard to know that you'll get actual support when you need it"
53,Tufts,"I think that some of the services largely run by students themselves (ie Ears for Peers, a student-run hotline) are very successful, and one of the greatest successes at tufts has been allowing them to exist. The actual resources offered by the university aren’t so successful, based on accounts of peers’ experiences, such that I have largely avoided them and have no firsthand experience."
54,Brandeis,"Brandeis is doing well in finding students who need support and recognizing their needs. It lacks however on how consistently and effectively it fulfills those needs. For example a student could reach out or be reached out to by the BCC to start therapy once a week, but that therapy may not actually help the student or give them the advice they need. "
55,Texas State University,"My college has counseling, support groups, psychiatry. I have been to counseling and psychiatry at my college. My psychiatrist was amazing but they recently no longer take my insurance. The counseling was not something I would recommend to others. It is limited to short term surface level issues and nothing else. I was referred to go off campus but not given any resources. "
56,Brigham Young University-Provo,"BYU has a nice counseling center; however, the staff is lacking, so waiting lists have always been long. I used the services before the pandemic and waiting lists would still require at least a month of waiting. I wish they could have sent me to another therapist outside of the school. BYU's Biofeedback resources are helpful, but most students don't understand their accessibility."
57,CU Boulder,"The let's talk hours are a good method of getting support when you haven't planned ahead, but can sometimes be busy enough that you can't get a chance to speak with a therapist. With the high demand for mental health support, it's just hard to schedule an appointment and find a time that works. Having more counseling staff would be great. "
58,Andrews University,"I know that when the school has events such as open gym or social acativities, that helps me by somewhat forcing me to take a break and enjoy. Sometimes it is hard to make yourself take a break. I would also add, having prayer meeting and Kenetic worship also helped me when I was at my most stressed this semester. "
59,San Diego State University,The telehealth line takes too long and seems overly complicated for someone like me (a severely anxious person). It would be nice if there were easier accessible online options for students that didn't just involve a phone call/zoom session where I have no idea what to say or do - especially as someone seeking mental health services for the first time.
60,Arizona State,"I know that they have several different options for talking to a counselor. However, there are many more students per councilor, which is likely one of the reasons that several suicides on campus have occurred from the lack of actual availability. In addition, dispite the reduced cost, therapy is still expensive, especially if you have long term issues like I do."
61,Wellesley,I feel as if there desperately needs to be more diversity on the counselling team as well as more response to student input. I feel like certain counsellors (Jan Park) are very harmful to students and simply need to be checked. I think the college does a good job of providing a little bit to everyone but this spreads it thin.
62,Sierra College,"My teachers make sure that the students know what resources are available which is good. There need to be more people available to talk about feelings and current events rather than just focusing on school schedules. Particularly for disabled students, POC, and other disadvantaged students. Typically our counselors focus on our school work, rather than doing something like CBT. "
63,SUNY College at Geneseo,"I would like to be able to have an actual therapist to talk to on campus. With teachers or counselors, I feel obligated to only gloss over my personal life and really focus on my academic needs. I feel as though that the health center does not help when it comes to referring students to a real therapist. "
64,Atlantic Cape Community College,"Im a rather new student so I can't say anything for certain. I can tell you that after being on campus for a semester, I know next to nothing about the mental health program here. I don't really need it (I seek counseling out of school) but it would be nice to know about for those that do. "
65,Ohio State,"The fact that mental health services are offered is a step in the right direction, but it does not seem to be meeting the sheer demand of students who require assistance. Counselling needs to be expanded, in addition to being made more accessible and personalised for students, or else its efficacy, in my opinion, will be severely limited."
66,UT Dallas,"I haven’t used any of the services, but in my freshman year I heard great things about our addiction counseling. There was a presentation where they  made sure to be very inclusive and open. Their services doesn’t limit addiction to substance abuse. Big gaming campus, so I know a lot of people can be helped there. 
"
67,LSU,"I haven’t gone through lsu for mental health services, but my friend has and they have treated her pretty well. she’s being covered by the lighthouse program and they have been really helpful for her. i can’t afford it, but it’d be nice if some of my fees i pay for school were allocated for mental health services."
68,Stony Brook University,"I think CAPS could be improved on. I didn't feel I really connected with my counselor when I had her. She didn't really remember things about my case and asked me the same questions week to week. If there were maybe more counselors who could connect more with their clients, I think it would be much more helpful."
69,Arizona State,"I attempted to get on campus counseling and everyone I spoke with refused to use my preferred name no matter how many times I corrected them. They all said they would write it down and put it in my file, but then use the wrong name the next time. I quit the counseling before my first appointment."
70,Dartmouth,"I appreciate that they’re really trying to tackle the mental health issue, but it’s telling that it only got real attention after the tragedies last year. But many of the things they promote are ineffective. The student wellness center almost only does yoga, as if yoga is the one and only way to get better mental health"
71,Fresno Pacific University,"I feel that our college does well in getting the news out there when it comes to counseling on campus but I have experienced my counseling getting interrupted and stopped because for whatever reason the person couldn't do it anymore. I had to change to another staff member but at that point I decided not to anymore.
"
72,UConn,"There are some weekly events at the end of each week that provide activities for students to unwind, and sometimes little things throughout the week like giveaways that are nice. I wish there was more promotion of programs offered by the college in regards to mental health services, as I’ve heard mediocre things about those services"
73,Arizona State,"I think encouraging the creation of online student communities. It can be difficult for online students to get to know each other beyond the classroom, and is limited within the classroom since classes are so big. While classes can have group discussions or projects, that is on an academic level with academic pressures and requirements. "
74,Arizona State,"Support and acknowledgement from my success coach Nino has been the most helpful resource for me when it comes to my mental health and school.
I believe instructors need to be more supportive and understanding of daily life obligations for online students. I know that kind of positivity and understanding would help my mental health. "
75,Sterling College (2),Mental health or wellness services and supports provided by my college that are working well are their free on-campus counseling and using tele-health services when needed. Aspects of mental health and wellness that need more attention are the diversity of the counseling staff and the inability to prescribe medications as a part of the college.
76,Arizona State,I am not aware of any mental health counseling or support on campus. Communicating that these resources are available should be increased beyond just mass emails. Advisors should be contacting students and/or mentioning the provided services as well as how to utilize them when helping students pick classes or whatever they may be speaking about.
77,USC,"There are programs like one called Wellness Wednesdays that are dedicated to de-stressing by spending time working on arts and crafts and I like going to this one. But I think they are lacking in free physical fitness classes or groups. Although my school encourages us to exercise, fitness classes are not free. "
78,Sewanee-The University of the South,"I have not sought out any counseling on campus simply for the lack of knowledge on how it works. I think a newsletter of some kind that shows where to go, who you will be seeing, how to schedule an appointment online with a provider, and programs available to students would be helpful. "
79,University of Nevada-Reno,The counseling center is great because they allow you to talk to someone the same day. There are also days where we can go out and talk to someone. They could use more attention with being able to create a more diverse schedule or allowing to book a few days ina d Vance 
80,Arizona State,"the strive to constantly get something right on the first try can really put a toll on mental health. for example, being able to fail a quiz & then trying again until you get it right is more valuable than playing memory games & having to get each question right the first time. "
81,Youngstown State University,None really if you reach out to counseling and have problems that can’t be fixed in 2 talks you are told you have to many problems and no one is going to have problems that can be fixed fast if you are going for depression or anxiety bc that’s just not how it works
82,Holmes Community College,"It would be pretty cool if we had diagnostics from professionals- like having the ability to have someone check your mental health. Not a lot of families allow their children to get a mental diagnosis, and that leads students concerned- not knowing if they are just going insane or actually have a mental disorder."
83,UTK,"Counselors on campus are lacking. My college needs more counselors and more training I feel for the counselors. I have only one experience with mental health services but my therapist from the student health center was demeaning, not helpful, and very cynical with my situation. It felt like I wasn't being believed."
84,Arizona State,I have not used any mental health or wellness supports from ASU as I am an online student and have a personal therapist. There needs to be more support groups whether it is on SunDevilSync or on Facebook for everyone to share their mental struggles and we not asking about academics. 
85,Washington State,"The counseling office is small and can't accommodate the number of students who are seeking mental health counseling. It makes it extremely difficult to get an appointment. As a student studying abroad right now, I do not feel like I have any support or connection to the mental health services at WSU."
86,UConn,"I have not yet taken advantage of any mental health or wellness services provided by my college. However, based on the things that I've heard from others, I would say that these services should be expanded. For example, more counselors and a more helpful hotline should be made available to students."
87,Ohio State,Student Life Disability Services and Counseling and Consultation Services have been really supportive and done well in helping those in need of mental health and wellness services. I think campus needs more available psychiatrists and group counseling to help those that need medication and benefit from therapy in small groups. 
88,Rowan,"I don't have an answer to the first question but for the second I think awareness of social factors' impact on mental health desperately needs to be addressed because mental health struggles are very different between financially secure straight white people vs. people of color, immigrants, poor people, LGBTQ, etc. groups"
89,University of Washington,"There is a lot that I don't use as I don't like to talk to people in person about my issues, but also don't want to put it online so it's a hard balance to follow, so more open about where and who I should talk to anonymously would be good."
90,Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University,"I appreciate that the Cook Counseling Center has multiple psychiatrists on staff who can prescribe/manage mental health medications (I've had bad experiences with some of the few off-campus providers before switching to Cook), and the reception/nursing staff that help manage appointments and Rx refill requests are quite helpful (especially Nurse Crystal)"
91,Florida International University,I believe that FIU has great mental health and wellness programs overall. I just find it a bit difficult to have access to them. I wish I could just call and be able to speak to a therapist about what I am feeling and what is going on in my life.
92,Arizona State,"I know only of two currently which is the counseling services and the 360 life services. They seem like they work great as I have not yet had to use them, however I am not sure how well they would work with being an only online student and having conflicting schedules"
93,Williams,I don’t think any work well. I had a tough time both times I tried using the college’s resources and ended up using Teledoc to get a off-label prescription for a heart drug that somewhat helps with anxiety (Teladoc didn’t have a psychiatrist so I resorted to a family doctor)
94,Oklahoma,"I have not personally used the mental health services on campus, but from what I have heard, they are helpful. The resources are definitely there. One of the biggest issues is that there is not enough staff, so people may not be able to immediately get in for help."
95,Colorado School of Mines,The initial meetings with the wellness services were good. The process was quick to see what resources I needed at the time. The staff was very caring. Now that I've moved on from that i feel like i still need help and i don't know how to ask again.
96,Duke,"There are many good wellness meetings and events. And there is good communication around east to access people to talk to, peers or therapists. However, the on campus therapists cannot do much and they don’t make it clear just how little they can do. E.G. can’t even diagnose adhd"
97,UMass Amherst,"Mindfulness programs provide great support. I don’t know the scope of UMass’ mental health programs as I seek  services outside of the college, but I would imagine it is not fully staffed or funded. There should be more focus in that area. Thank you for conducting this survey."
98,Georgia,"I'm not sure what mental health or wellness services/supports are provided by my college but in general, I've heard that the quality of such services (mental health/wellness) isn't very good quality nor long-lasting. I think the overall sector of it in UGA has to be improved and more funded."
99,Arizona State,"The counselors on campus are generally nice, but very, very busy. I’ve known people personally who have had very negative reports of how ASU handles what they perceive to be an emergency. I think there needs to be professional victim advocates for people who have experienced sexual assault. "
100,University of Arizona,"I'm not sure which mental health or wellness services and supports are working well. I feel that having a club of some sort would help which leads to building bonds. Then, I'd feel like I have an obligation to see these people and get the help I need. "
101,University of Arizona,Campus health is easily accessible and I do believe it is covered by student insurance. There should be a 24/7 location or hotline to contact when needed and the off campus resources need to be expanded. Everything just needs to be talked about more frequently as well. 
102,UIC,What’s working well is the on site availability of support however anything over the internet or phone can be hard to schedule with your time and to access making the appointments can be a bit tedious especially when you may want help but need it a bit sooner
103,University of Minnesota,I genuinely can’t think of any resource that is actually timely and helpful. There are next to no counseling sessions available since every single one of the sessions is booked. PAWS is a bs program that is only a temporary solution to a difficult and complex issue 
104,Temple,"Last semester, there was a time where dogs were brought to the library to de-stress around finals. I thought it was nice, but there should be things open for the entire semester/year and be open for everyone, without anything possibly restricting them, such as a dog allergy "
105,Oswego,The counseling center is way over booked. Students either can’t get an appointment or they only get like one or two each semester. This is something that many people need consistency with. The college needs more funding so that they can hire additional mental health counselors and therapists.
106,University of Iowa,"I have been on the waitlist for seeing a counselor at the LGBTQ Clinic for over 3 months now. I understand this is a busy time for them, but this is ridiculous, they could at least recommend somewhere else to go or somebody to see on campus."
107,Ohio State,"I think the programs and people running it are nice and supportive. Even online meetings feel beneficial. However, there should be more ""marketing"" or increase awareness of these resources. They need to normalize it more so that people who need help won't be scared to reach out."
108,Amherst,"I think the college has done a great job of diversifying the type of mental health help students can receive (ie. group counseling, affinity group focused counseling, etc.). I also think that there could be more attention given to increasing the number of counselors available to students."
109,UB,"There is a mental health center, however I greatly urge and ask for there to be a way to sign up for appointments online and not solely through telephone calls, as those too are very stressful for some people and makes getting an appointment a daunting task."
110,University of Wisconsin-River Falls,I have consistently been very pleased with the mental health support that UWRF has provided me. The one thing that I wish that you guys would do is establish and maintain connections with local deliverance ministries so that people like me would know which ministries are available.
111,Johnson County Community College,I am online so I don’t really go in person. I’ve never looked into these things because I didn’t know they were there. It probably has been sent to me as information in an email but I never saw it. Definitely will be looking into it. 
112,Kalamazoo College,"I think K College is good at promoting the Counseling services, but I do think they need to hire more diverse counselors and have a more accessible way to fill out the forms so students don't have another barrier that stops them from accessing counseling. "
113,Arizona State,"Great counsellors in the program, success coaches are really good at directing students towards these mental health resources.

I think having more money going towards mental health facilities would be a good idea as everyone's mental health has seemed to get a bit worse after the pandemic."
114,Barnard,"There are wellness activities throughout the semester and especially during high stress periods. It is difficult for me to find long term therapy on campus because I am on my personal insurance, and long term on campus resources only apply to those on Barnard insurance. "
115,Florida,"Zoom counseling is available if needed for a few free sessions. However, it's done by people who are just learning so it's somewhat limited. Psychiatry and other services are done by referral through the original counselor or through a third party and feel out of reach."
116,Crowder College,"We have a good on campus councilor that addresses almost all of the problems that the students at our campus report, but she does have a hard time getting to the root of the problem when the student is not entirely sure what the problem is."
117,University of Alaska,The UAA Student Health and Counseling Center and UAA Care Team services are great services provided by my college to help students who are struggling with mental health issue. Students also have the option to anonymously advocate for teh wellness of a fellow student. 
118,University of Arizona,I think the cost of some mental health resources is what is not working well. Our diversity of the counselors can be improved upon because some people are more comfortable with a woman over a man or need someone closer to them in race/ethnicity. 
119,UT Dallas,"Having six sessions for free is great- they're really triage though, and getting told straight up at your intake appointment that your issues are above their expertise level is pretty disheartening to say the least, lol. That's the game with college campus services I guess."
120,University of Alaska,"I honestly think all of it is amazing so far, I visit the therapists and nurses a lot right now and it’s all been covered by tuition and fees. Everyone is super friendly and I always leave feeling like I had everything taken care of"
121,Arizona State,I feel like the teachers need more training and understanding of how different mental illnesses affect school work. I have had many teachers be patient with me but also a handful who have completely blown me off and wouldn’t help me in any way. 
122,UTK,"I know my college campus provides some therapists on-campus for students, which is great. However, I have heard from others that the service is very, very limited. You can only have a certain amount of appointments, and the amount of therapists is too small. "
123,Notre Dame,I mean we have a counseling center which I guess is something but we are severely understaffed and it's very difficult to get an appointment during hours and impossible after business hours so you better not have any problems on the weekends I guess.
124,USC,"Though I have never attended, I appreciate the Let's Talk drop-in sessions available through my school. What might need more attention is the availability of counseling sessions, as I remember when I tried to make an appointment back in 2020 there were none available."
125,Mercer ,"Offering CAPS is a great way to provide wellness. However, the resource is the only thing offered regarding mental health, and more students than ever are suffering. There needs to be other options besides CAPS, which only benefits certain people, but definitely not all."
126,UB,"Probably free counseling due to there not being any issues. I would say just keeping in touch with people in general. Even if people put on a face, if you see them more often you'd probably see what kind of issues they're dealing with."
127,College of DuPage,I do need help with mental health personally but I know a lot of people who have no one to go to so I think it would be nice if we had people like that . Just Someone people could go to to talk.
128,Temple,"Tuttleman Counseling is nice when you have access to a counselor, but not many people seem to have the privilege of that, since many are referred out. I think there should be more done related to trauma and news, such as racially-charged incidents "
129,Stony Brook University,"CAPS needs to add an option for students to schedule appointments online, not just over phone. I have friends who struggle with phone anxiety that would greatly benefit from counseling services, but cannot make the phone call to set up an appointment. "
130,CU Boulder,"Working Well: Communication of help available

Not Working Well: The help available. Student issues feel like they are not often taken as seriously as they should be and the clinic is often booked far out, meaning a student in crisis now cannot get help."
131,Wellesley,"What was the worst for me was the fact that the mental health resources of the school aren't available for study abroad students, which I get is due to licensing but I would have appreciated more resources being available during study abroad programs."
132,Barnard,"Not much in my opinion I’d working well. I think the diversity needs to increase for the counselors available, there really needs to be an increase in counselors too since scheduling is so limited and it could take weeks to get an appointment."
133,Arizona State,"Success coaching has been good, but could be more personal and those questions of mental health could be asked without pressuring the student. A personal connection to feel like someone is on your side and there to listen really helped in those meetings."
134,Harrisburg Area Community College,"I love that there is an option of taking a mental health day as a student, it goes a long way. Something that could be improved is the flexibility of the “mental health day” for students in a more fast paced programs(e.g nursing)."
135,Coastal Carolina Community College,"I mean, you have to actively look for someone like a counselor to help you.. I only know of people because I'm close to some faculty.. so there's no way to really know they're there without seeking, but they are always available. "
136,CU Boulder,"There are plenty of resources that are helpful like a certain amount t of free counseling sessions, but the staff are not diverse which does not help any students that would like to talk to someone they feel they can relate to"
137,Florida,"I think the short-term sessions are great, but the fact that it can take months to get a consultation before starting to talk to someone is ridiculous. A person’s mental state could severely deteriorate before they’re able to see someone on campus."
138,Arizona State,"There is a lot of awareness about resources, but that awareness does not translate to accessibility. For example, the SAILS program is mentioned often by professors, TAs, on-campus health staff, etc., but getting an appointment and getting accommodations approved takes weeks. "
139,Stony Brook University,I like the idea of CAPS but it seems very small compared to the need on a large campus. I have looked at it before but not sure if they had someone who could help for what I am looking for. 
140,University of Washington,"I don't really use the mental health or wellness services from my college, but I used the call system once and it didn't help very much since they weren't connected with the school. They weren't able to talk to professors or anything"
141,Haverford College,I don't really use any of the services on campus but I've heard from friends that they just aren't very good at what they do? I'm also aware that it's really hard to get an appointment and get a therapist on campus
142,WashU,The Habif mental health staff need more attention. There is such little staff that appointments are RARE. Uncle Joes is a good resource but students shouldn’t have to rely on peers due to inaccessibility to professional mental health services on campus.
143,Arizona State,"I haven't went to mental-health counseling because I take care of my mental health alone majority of the time, but I would say depression and anxiety are some major aspects of mental health that needs more attention that it already has."
144,Arizona State,I feel that the in person counseling services are very accessible. I feel like there is very little awareness of the limitations of the campus counseling and what steps a student should take to get help beyond steps 1 or 2.
145,Arizona State,I would say currently they have done a great job in making it known services are available and how to use said services. I would say there should be a way for them to focus past issues of anxiety and depression.
146,Arizona State,"I think that having counseling students intern as counselors is helpful because there is less intimidation when talking to them, but on the other side of that I feel as thought they may not be entirely qualified to help some people"
147,Ohio State,"I like the counseling that is offered but wish there was a way (covered by insurance) to get my medications. It’s so hard to get a psychiatrist appointment right now, and even harder to find ones that are covered. "
148,University of Alaska,I think it's a good thing that people with mental health issues can get special support.  I think it would be an improvement if people were given more opportunities to do activities with others that tend to improve wellness.
149,Arizona State,"An aspect that needs more attention is the understaffing of CS on campus, I know students that have gone for initial consultations only to be directed elsewhere after and they didn’t continue with that for one reason or another "
150,Washington Adventist University,"Telehealth has helped me alot with my mental health issues. However, I wish we had in-person counselors on campus because it is not the same talking to someone over a zoom call or on the phone as in person. "
151,UMich,"None, psychologist and therapist appointments are months out and if you go to them saying you're in an emergency you're locked up in the pysch ward for 72 hours with no beds, food, or phone access to call for help"
152,Youngstown State University,"I'm not to sure as I have not gone for help, but from what I have heard, they are quick to diagnose kids with ADHD and give them medication. Some kids' problems are more deeply rooted and greater than ADHD"
153,UIC,"The wellness center and the commuter center are great resources and communicate well through emails. I enjoy the events they organize.

I would like there to be more information about where and how to get in contact with a wellness counseler."
154,South Carolina,"There are options, and they are fairly knowledgeable.  However, they are too focused on crisis intervention and not focused enough on providing services for those who are not in crisis but still struggle a lot with their mental health."
155,UPenn,"The counselors and psychiatrists work very well when you can get an appointment. However, you generally have to wait weeks or months to get a first appointment and the physical location of the services is so far away from campus."
156,College of the Sequoias,"I have not used any programs, but I have noticed their availability and the schools encouragement to utilize those services. I think they have done incredibly well, but making private, over the phone resources more well known would be helpful."
157,UConn,"I think the on-call talks with social workers to get service or talk about the current struggles I may have at the moment. But, I wish there is more availability like a wider span of times and days. "
158,UMich,The counseling center is just burdened with the amount of students that need help. It's simply the volume of students that need help. The services aren't even that bad if they were just able to reach more people. 
159,Colorado School of Mines,"I can’t really say anything works well. I called our counseling center in spring 2021 and referred to an off campus online therapy service, had my appointments that I waited months for canceled twice. It was pretty disheartening "
160,Oberlin,"Current counseling services are lacking. Would MUCH prefer off campus counseling, also gives students a chance to get off campus, which in of itself feels like a suffocating prison surrounded by crime if you leave to the East "
161,Arizona State,"From what I know, the only type of mental support that exists on my campus is the counseling services we can go to but that's about it. Definitely need to provide a variety of options to seek mental health"
162,MIT,Expertise - I felt like I was talking to myself and solving my problems because my therapist didn’t give a professional opinion at a time when I thought I had many things wrong with me and needed clarity. 
163,University of Minnesota,"I tried reaching out to campus mental health service online last semester, which was when i needed the most help but didnt get reply till now. So now i just tried to not rely on them and help myself"
164,George Mason University,"Overall everyone was very understanding and were patient with me. However, the department only allows calls to set appointments which is not easy for those with mental health issues/concerns. Having an email system would be much more inviting. "
165,Alabama,I understand counseling is a profession but we pay so much in tuition and counseling on campus still costs money. Many don’t seek help because they cannot afford it due to the insane tuition prices they’re already paying. 
166,Barnard,"I think it would be more helpful to increase the amount of psychiatric services provided. I really appreciated that they were available, but getting access to them was very challenging, and they weren't a long-term solution, which was frustrating."
167,EKU,"whenever i’ve tried making an appointment with my colleges therapists, they never really have time slots available when i’m available, so i think it might help if they had more therapists available during more times throughout the day "
168,Louisville,None of them. We only have one counseling office and it was so backed up that it took me a month to even get a triage/meeting and they simply forgot to send me the email FOR the triage. 
169,Arizona State,"Ultimately, I believe that my university is very well educated on and equipped for offering diverse and more than sufficient mental health resources, and it now comes down to student choice and students approaching and accepting the proffered help."
170,UMass Amherst,There are not enough counselors and I have heard so many stories (including my own experience) where friends have wanted to go to counseling services and they are told they have to wait months to book an appointment
171,University of Arizona,"I think that there are a large variety of mental health treatment options to help students who are experiencing a wide variety of situations. However, I think it is not as accessible as it could be (price wise)."
172,University of Wisconsin-Madison,"My school has a 24 hour crisis line and counseling services available to all students. However, the amount of appointments that a student can have and the wait time to get an appointment is a serious barrier. "
173,Virginia,"Many students have complained that the therapists and counseling services offered through the University are unhelpful at best. Therapists are described as apathetic and dismissive of issues, while the pace of referrals and appointments is extremely sluggish. "
174,Arizona State,"I have never used counseling services at ASU; however, I have highly considered giving it a try. I would like more attention on being physically ""at peace"" (i.e. coming to terms with how you look, accepting your body)."
175,Salt Lake Community College,"I appreciate SLCC efforts for inclusion and diversity. Despite the fact that we still have a long way to go, I feel like SLCC does the best job out of all major universities/colleges in the whole state. "
176,Three Rivers College,There is one counselor that the college pays for (until fall semester this year) named Ryan Walker and he's been great. I just feel it's not a good idea to have 1 person for thousands of students. 
177,UC Berkeley,The undocumented student program runs individual and group sessions which supplements the times when you don't have an individual appointment. I think more staff should be hired so that they can reach more students on time. 
178,Stony Brook University,"No, they just redirect me to my in network resources, but they are generally very racist places to be, so very unhelpful. I ended up going through my primary physician after months of wasting time with SBU."
179,Arizona State,"The website and app seems helpful, but a little confusing! I tried to find a counselor, but then I got too busy and it didn’t work out, so I don’t have too much experience with it! "
180,UTK,"There are mental health resources widely available, which is extremely beneficial. However, there is such a long waitlist for counseling sessions, so my fear is that people who need urgent help are not going to receive it."
181,Arizona State,"I have not utilized the campus health or wellness services because I have my own resources that I consider more private. As an online student, I don't feel I have the same access that on-campus students enjoy."
182,UTEP,I feel that every aspect of that UTEP  has on mental health is going well. It would be nice to see more advertisements of our mental health resources on and off campus that are offered. 
183,University of Kansas,"I felt like the school just kinda pushed my mental health aside when I met with a counselor. They just referred me to a therapy group in the town, but I couldn’t go there due to insurance"
184,Miami University,Only time I've had experience with these services was when my professor let the school know I was going though a difficult time so you guys reached out. That was nice because it was prompt and helpful
185,UC Merced,They have a center called CAPS that you can make appointments with but they are always filled up. That is pretty much all they have so I'd wish they had more options or more space available
186,Tufts,I think the mental health department is good but just lacking funding and resources. It’s hard to schedule staff for counseling appointments and there also isn’t much importance placed on mental health in comparison to schoolwork.
187,Northern Arizona University,"they don't have enough counselors and they also don't really do a lot of specified work, but a lot of places off campus are wildly expensive, so there's limited options to get help for serious diagnoses/ESAs/etc."
188,UB,"We need more accessibility to on-campus counseling services. What UB has right now is not sufficient, especially when they don't really help and are hard to reach. The limits on counseling appointments is not helpful either."
189,Haverford College,"On campus free therapy, makes it affordable and an option for everyone on campus. We need more therapists, though, because wait times are extremely long. Also, a dedicated health and wellness building would be beneficial. "
190,University of Washington,I have looked at group counseling but they are still remote. I am tired of remote and don't want it simple because it's remote. If it were in person I would definitely go to group therapy.
191,George Mason University,"The help seems alright, I personally don’t know how to fix it. But I think for most students it’s scary going in for the first time so somehow making it more normalized or welcoming could help"
192,Utah,Theres a lot of resources which is nice but the biggest issue is a high turn over rate of college counselors which lessens wanting to seek help on campus and professors not being lenient/understand nag 
193,UIC,"I feel that at first the group therapy was helpful as a stress relief, but eventually it became an anxiety of having to participate and eventually feeling uncomfortable in that environment sharing my personal issues. "
194,Ohio State,"Students are advocating for themselves and their peers and the University addresses the fact that they need more mental health resources. At this point, we just need them to take action and do something about it."
195,Arizona State,"I haven’t been provided with very many services or supports, but it would be nice to have a mediator system to be able to mediate mental health discussions with resistant professors to be heard better"
196,Georgia,"I think the college needs to focus on getting more therapists and people to help students. I tried signing up for mental health services and was put on a waitlist, which didn’t help me any"
197,University of Arizona,"The services are intimidating to even learn about online, and expensive. It's futile to have mental health services if they aren't free; financial struggles are some of the biggest stressors leading to mental health crises....."
198,New York University,I know we have the wellness center but I have not used it. From my friends that have I hear staffing is the biggest issue since there are so many students and not enough counselors.
199,Emory,Timely MD was a great addition. Just all psychiatry as a whole. Students should be able to get in to see someone immediately. Mental health isn't something that can wait a couple of months. 
200,Rowan,"The mental health services in the Wellness Center are really good, as there are many different options for treatment. However, the college sometimes has a difficult time communicating these resources with the student population "
201,Arizona State,"I know nothing of the mental health services offered on campus. 

Even if I did, seeking them out would require me to pay even more for parking which already is a large financial stressor. "
202,Stony Brook University,"While I have not used the mental health services on campus, I am aware that they have a 24 hour hotline which I appreciate. However, I have heard that the counselling is not particularly useful"
203,Stony Brook University,I haven’t used any of stony mental health resources so i’m not sure but based on other peoples experiences i believe they should have a 24 hour service with people who are more empathetic 
204,Stony Brook University,"The student support team at my college has been very helpful in supporting my mental health.

I think more attention should be paid on the negative impact of stress from school has on students' mental health."
205,Virginia,"The counselor I saw was very kind and helpful in connecting me to resources. However, emergency services are lacking and therapy visits can only do so much for the overall wellness of the student community."
206,Davidson College," Mainly one counselor, Jasmine, has been helpful. Need more services/talks about nutrition/body image for students of color and athletes of color because Elizabeth Allred is not a safe space to discuss either of those."
207,University of Nebraska-Lincoln,"The college provides very limited mental health support. It is there for small issues, like friendship or homesickness. It is NOT for deep rooted issues or anything further than a little anxiety and depression"
208,New York University,"What’s working wel is they’re heavily connected with external sources. However, I do think they need to hire more psychiatrists so that people can quickly go through REAL treatment and be prescribed medication. "
209,Sewanee-The University of the South,Nothing works as well as it should.  We need more counselors and psychologists who will help and not collect an hourly coin as my friends share their issues with no guidance or resolve.
210,University of Arizona,"CAPS is working particularly well, but only for short-term issues. I wish there was a better option for long-term therapy with less focus on doing well academically and a bigger focus on holistic outlooks"
211,University of Washington,"Maybe something surrounding family. I know from experience that talking about your mental health and emotions isn’t something families to normally and it makes it extremely hard to open up, even to friends "
212,UB,"I hear none, and the major I'm in(Computer science) is not taking care of the feeling of the students at least in my perspective. There is just a due day over another due day."
213,UNC,One on one counseling was working well. However this support was short term. I did it for a semester but there is not many options for support for me on campus after that semester.
214,University of California-Santa Barbara,"I think that there needs to be greater accessibility to on campus counseling and therapy. If it was easier to get an appointment, or talk to someone over the phone, it would be easier"
215,Youngstown State University,My experience with the colleges mental health services was perfect I can't really suggest anything to improve it beyond what I experienced. However that does not mean there is not room for improvement somewhere.
216,Arizona State,"Telehealth is easily accessible. But I hope there’s more information on mental health and how to handle it whether it would be you or your friends. Also, more information on how to get therapy."
217,Arizona State,I think there needs to be more options for Online students. I get all the info about on campus options but I’m not ever on campus - I’m an out of state student. 
218,UMass Amherst,I think the university does a good job advertising different support groups but I think that there should be more access to counselors. I have heard that it is difficult to find an appointment
219,Oregon,I think virtual counseling/telecounseling through Zoom has been extremely helpful because more students are willing to seek help when they don’t have to meet the counselor in person due to anxiety and other reasons.
220,Moody Bible Institute,The MTS Counseling Center is flexible with their pricing which I really appreciate. I think that there needs to be more map instructions/how to get to counseling's physical locations in the counseling posters. 
221,Brigham Young University-Idaho,There is a counseling center but it is always booked months out and by the time you get to a meeting I’m not sure your concern would be needed to be addressed anymore. 
222,Stanford,"Haven't used it to know--but from my impression limited attention is given to men/male issues due to sexism, and inability to address issues faced by Christians being persecuted (for instance from own family)"
223,Ohio State,"OSU’s counseling and consultation services is a complete mess. It is advertised as a therapy option, yet students in crisis aren’t able to get in for months, and the help is near useless"
224,Rutgers,"One-on-one Therapy Talks 

Aspects of mental health and wellness that need more attention would probably be more of a psychiatrist on campus that can diagnose if someone has any sort of disorder. "
225,College of Charleston,"I can't say I've used any services personally, but I know there's always signs and posters for the cougar counseling and the texting line thing that they have, and that seems good. "
226,UIC,"I have not used any of them, but I heard that my classmates really appreciate the services that the college offers. Although I do feel that they should advertise these services more. "
227,UC Riverside,Yeah I’ll be there at around noon and I just got home and I’ll get back home from church lol I have a lot of stuff going to my house so I’ll 
228,Tufts,"We need so much more, it is impossible to get an appointment in an at all reasonable amount of time, and with mental health, this is a major issue and can be dangerous."
229,Emory,"I haven’t implemented most of the mental health resources, but I’d hazard a guess that, like in all other areas, Emory could stand to strengthen its communication skills in regards to mental health."
230,George Mason University,I haven’t used campus services because I get confused about the extent of the services provided. And word of mouth from other students about their poor experiences made me doubt campus services. 
231,Arizona State,In my opinions I don’t think any of the ASU offered wellness services work. They are never really able to help students. I think the entire department needs to be reevaluated and help.
232,Wheaton College (1),I would like more on-campus assistance regarding the diagnosis of mental illness or learning disabilities. I'm currently in the process of seeking a diagnosis and I wish there was more support on campus.
233,Western New England University,"I am not sure; I have not used any yet. I believe spreading information about services, specifically counseling services, should get more attention. Maybe looking at doing in-person counseling should be looked at."
234,UTEP,I believe that the concealing is working very well on my campus however showing students how to use it and why it is important to use it is an aspect that needs attention
235,Santa Barbara City College,I’m not sure; I’ve sought mental health services outside of school because of concern that struggles I’ve had related to the nursing program would be shared and jeopardize my success in it. 
236,UConn,the cheap sessions offered by grad students supervised by professionals seems like a really good way to give everyone access even if they dont have insurance or dont want their parents to know
237,UMich,"To be honest, they always say there are opportunities, but I've heard plenty of horror stories from both UHS psych and bad experiences at CAPS that I hesitate to rely on them"
238,Ohio State,"I gave up on my college's mental health services long ago. I reached out to them expressing that I was suicidal, and I was put on a four month long waiting list."
239,Florida International University,I believe the therapists being offered are working well because although I haven’t attended any therapy session I’ve had friends who have and they had positive things to say about it. 
240,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,"Campus needs more people to provide more long term services. If you want individual attention, you only get it for a semester, so it would work better if there were more staff."
241,Florida International University,I have not had the opportunity to experience any of my college’s mental health & wellness services but I know that they are well equipped to accommodate students with mental health issues.
242,Arizona State,"I know that many (or all) professors include mental health help information in the course syllabus. However, it is not usually the first place one may think to get the resource information."
243,Barnard,I think the college does a good job of letting people know where they can get certain services but they could work on making those services more accessible and also more approachable
244,Brigham Young University-Provo,I'm not at all aware of what resources are available. It would be great if the university could do more to make students aware of what kind of supports they can find.
245,UConn,What works well is the events they plan every once in a while that bring awareness to mental health. What doesn't work well is the lack of availability of in person counseling.
246,University of Arizona,"I'm not sure since I haven't used these services before. Personally, I would spend more attention on personal relationships since that's what has been affected the most throughout the pandemic for me
"
247,Arizona State,I feel like the ability to talk to a counselor through the campus whenever you need it is a good resource. I wish that there was a psychiatric professional available on campus.
248,University of Arizona,"CAPS, it is very difficult as a student and having professors seem to disregard mental health. Perhaps flagging when a good student is failing, or isn’t showing up to classes. Helping them?"
249,Ole Miss,The presentation of possible services such as telehealth and the ease of use for mental health services is good. I think mental health check ups could be implemented through the semester more.
250,UCLA,I think the triage needs more attention. It seems excessive to wait at least 45 minutes to get help. But their referral plan has excellent rates if you have school insurance. 
251,Middlesex Community College (1),"I’m not sure, but we have emails being sent out but it’s hard for us to see them due to us needing to log in and look NF or them personally "
252,Monroe Community College,We have a counselor and my coach has bi weekly meetings for mental health. Im not sure what else other than a nurse on campus who could like prescribe medication would help.
253,Marian University (1),I only know of one mental health employee but do not know how to reach them or what to do. The therapy they provide is also catholic based which I am not
254,Williams,"There are not enough therapists, and campus culture as a whole is pretty toxic when it comes to mental health. The response from the administration is not consistent across professors "
255,UC Davis,"The resources are top notch when you are able to access them, although unfortunately it is so difficult to even try to get an appointment because they are all booked CONSTANTLY!!!!!!!!!!"
256,UMass Amherst,I haven't used any mental health services on campus so I can't really answer that question. I think one thing that needs to be focused on more is just overall loneliness.
257,Rowan,"I like the therapy dogs at the wellness center, and the staff that they have there are nice. I think it just needs to be expanded to accommodate more students. "
258,University of North Carolina at Charlotte,The school's CAPS program overall is ok. Sessions are very limited so right when I felt I was finally making progress I hit the limit on my sessions for the semester.
259,George Mason University,I think college does a great job with weekly emails and information spread throughout the campus through various announcements and posters. I think the grade and time management needs more attention.
260,UC Berkeley,I've never been able to make an appointment despite trying. The ability to make an appointment online without calling a number would be extremely helpful. Also just more appointments being available.
261,UNC,Need health services that aren’t necessarily people who are on campus so that we could have more privacy.  That is why I’m not using the services provided.  More privacy
262,Stony Brook University,I think having events focused on wellness including fun ones like dog therapy are useful. The mental health counselors can help sometimes but more resources and consuleors should be available. 
263,Penn State,I like that it exists. But I would love if it got expanded more to include a bigger staff to support more students. That way it would be more accessible 
264,UNC,We need more wellness days and the university needs to acknowledge that. Doing a schoolwide thing that is not on university day and where are the support groups on campus 
265,Arizona State,"I’m glad that my school offers counseling and mental health services.  However, they are very difficult to get an appointment with and they are not available as a regular counselor."
266,Oberlin,"I really like my therapist, and I've been able to switch around until I found somebody I liked, but I'm having to wait over a month for a psychiatry appointment. "
267,Volunteer State Community College,"put more about getting mental health help/counseling options on the volstate website (or make it easier to find, because I still struggle to find helpful info of who to talk to)"
268,Iowa Central Community College,"I talked to the counselor on staff.  We were able to talk about the challenges as mental health professionals, but itnwas hard to connect to them on a student level."
269,Mizzou,"They do a decent job of advertising what ""is available"". Unfortunately, when I've tried to utilize services they were unable to support me due to lack of staff and resources, etc."
270,Rowan,I have used the resources at the wellness center for my mental health even before the pandemic and I think it needs help especially sense what happened last semester 
271,Georgia,The way schoolwork doesn't put itself on hold while we try to find help. It's not like we can focus on our mental health because we have work to do
272,Dordt College,"Good college counseling services, just need more supports to reach all students. More acceptance of receiving counseling services/less stigma. Requirement of receiving counseling for students in human service professions. "
273,Keene State College,"I have not used any of the college services so I am unsure, but I do see signs around the college about counseling and where to find mental health help."
274,Arizona State,"I really don't know because I have never used any of their mental health services. I know ASU has quite a variety of services, but I've never checked them out."
275,Arizona State,"Unfortunately, I am not taking advantage of any support provided my college. I am completely unaware of what is available, and I wish I knew more about what was available."
276,Oregon State University,I have a success counselor from the college who's really good at recommending both on and off campus services when a problem is beyond her expertise. She's very open 
277,Portland State University,"They do a good job promating the mental health support and services, but I would like to see more awareness of other mental health issues other than depression and anxiety."
278,UC Davis,I wish there were more counseling in person appointments with a therapist. It is hard to schedule an appointment and hard to find one that aligns with your needs 
279,Florida International University,"From what I know, the school provides a good amount of resources for student mental health, including counseling. I am not aware of any aspects that need more attention. "
280,Ithaca College,I do not really use any mental health services. It might be because there aren’t that many offers; so overall more offers for mental health services would be beneficial 
281,New York University,"I never participated in the wellness services provided by my college; however, my college does offer 24-hour mental health counseling through phone calls (and a mobile app I believe). "
282,Southern Union State Community College,I feel like having more professsionals available online and in person on campus to speak to would help a lot with not just mental health but other resources as well.
283,College of the Siskiyous,I literally never knew that there were mental health services on campus/offered by the college because I take my courses online. More advertising specifically for online students would be great.
284,UNC,I think it should be free for all students who want it. At least 10 sessions with a mental health professional should be available to us each school year.
285,Williams,"As mentioned, I've not taken much of my opportunities to use the wellness services on campus, but from what I've heard an expansion of one-on-one counseling might be useful."
286,Rowan,The pet therapy program is not as effective (I've heard) as the university hoped for. Most people are disappointed that money is going towards this than expanding counseling services.
287,UMass Amherst,"CCPH is understaffed and underfunded to serve the entire UMass community. The programs in place are advertised to students, but the therapy itself is largely inaccessible and unprofessional. "
288,Ohio State,Drop-in counselling is not bad. Student disability services are fairly accessible as well. It would be nice if counselling was a little easier to understand how to get. 
289,University of Arizona,"the basic counseling works cwell, but i think we need more support for the system so it doesn't take as long, peoploe can see more specialized counselors, etc. "
290,UC Riverside,"Mental health and wellness programs based in a college should be more practical. Students need help finishing their degrees, that's the biggest stressor from outside and inside their lives."
291,University of Hawaii at Manoa,I'm not fully aware of all the mental health or wellness services provided by the school so I think it needs to be promoted more and posted throughout campus.
292,Clemson,"Don’t know, I don’t use them. People need to grow up and learn how to work on their problems themselves instead of playing a victim and demanding help. "
293,Sewanee-The University of the South,The new physical fitness center greatly helps mental health by providing group workout sessions that allow for exercise to benefit the body and mind while also getting human interaction
294,Barnard,"Well-woman is working very well in my opinion. I wish that the school would expand it!!!! Anxiety and depression in students need more attention, especially during specific seasons. "
295,University of Delaware,My roommate uses the free therapy here and says it works well. I personally have not used many resources provided by the university in terms of mental health. 
296,Oregon,"We have a team of therapists and I believe a few psychiatrists, who provide therapy and can prescribe medication. However, they're just unprepared to deal with so many students."
297,UMich,"Therapy dogs seem to be quite popular, but the counseling provided by CAPS needs to be more accessible to students for longer periods of time before recommending off-campus help."
298,Boston College,"I really enjoyed counseling when I went. However, when they told me i couldn’t do long term counseling, i never heard from them again and felt left alone. "
299,University of Delaware,Seans house is nice they have counselors and support animals I think there just needs to be more on site counseling and also let students know where that is
300,UC Davis,I believe their student health and wellness program is good and is an outlet for good resources. I believe their online resources such as tele-counseling needs more help. 
301,IU,There is CAPS but there is only one free session and there is not a lot of compatibility with insurance providers making it very hard to get help. 
302,Arizona State,"Peer counseling is advertised well. However, these are college aged peers. They don't know what they're doing. They should have a certification/program of some kind if they don't already"
303,Haverford College,"CAPS is working pretty well for me, but I wish there was a way to feel more connected to other students in my effort to improve my mental health."
304,Pitt,I did not know that we were able to get free counseling for a semester. It is still a bit unclear about how to schedule an appointment too. 
305,CWRU,None I’ve been to health counselling several times and the counsellor always ends up leaving CWRU after a year. Or I just don’t match well with the counsellor 
306,Rochester,Certain number of free therapy sessions are good but not enough. Quality of therapists seem to be a hit or a miss. I seem to have lucked out.
307,Goshen College,I think during freshman orientation you should connect the students with the  counselors and show them how they can sign up for meetings and stuff  
308,UCLA,General counseling is working well but not everyone reaches out so they need to make bigger emphasis on how and who to reach out snd establish meetings 
309,WashU,There are a good number of available resources but I feel like they should advertise them more. Like tell people how (and in what situations) they can help.
310,UT Austin,"We need more counselors, but all of them are great. Group counseling is very good and relevant and the mind body labs are very helpful and accessible. "
311,Middlebury College,"Telehealth counseling with on-campus, Middlebury-hired counselors is working alright. I am hoping that post-COVID, there will be more agency in choice to go in-person or maintain online counseling."
312,Virginia Commonwealth University,"VCU needs to offer free, confidential therapy to students  who may not be able to afford a therapist or whose parents dont support the idea of therapy"
313,CU Boulder,There are some resources but I don’t really have time to interact with them nor do I want to. my professors high expectations stress me out the most
314,UC Davis,"Each Aggie Matters is a great program I've seen in social media and at therapy fluffy events, but I don't know what it has to offer beyond that"
315,Tufts,"I haven't struggled much with my mental health over the course of my time here so far, so I have very little experience with the wellness services here."
316,UCLA,The fact that there isn't a way to make it absolutely free is a bit worrying. People shouldn't have added financial concern when seeking mental health help. 
317,University of Minnesota,My college works well in communicating about the various mental health resources on campus. More attention is needed to expanding the mental health department in its diversity. 
318,Florida International University,Telecounseling reaches many students who don’t live close to campus. I personally like to go to in person counseling because I like real one in one interaction. 
319,University of Nebraska-Lincoln,"I have not been too concerned with the college’s mental health program since I work for the state and live in Lincoln, both of which also have programs."
320,Arizona State,I think that there needs to be more people who care. Just be l cause I call a number does not mean they will actually go their job
321,University of Arizona,"I don’t know too much about campus mental health resources, so I can’t say. I do think more effort needs to be put into promoting campus wellness resources."
322,Virginia,"Well: constantly reminding students of CAPS, focus on students with poor mental health, lots of opportunities to seek help
Poor: limited focus on maintaining good mental health in students"
323,Sandhills Community College,I am more likely to attend telehealth service. I also would benefit from being able to obtain a prescription for anxiety. And for ADHD services which aren’t offered.
324,Florida,CWC counseling is really difficult to get into. DRC works really well to help alleviate some of the stressors / pressures that school has on mental health.
325,Stanford,"""Mental health"" as a construct needs to be defrocked of its ostensibly unique social healing power that it has been implicitly attributed through increased attention and funding."
326,Ohio State,"When someone needs assistance, I want my college to focus on making sure that person receives the help they need. Follow up is not the best. "
327,Williams,People in crises were unable to even get appointments during the fall. That was unacceptable and the college needs to make sure it doesn't happen again. 
328,Johns Hopkins University,The nutritionist at the student health and wellness center used to provide me with a good support for my poor relationship with food and body image. 
329,University of Arizona,"While I'd like to use the campus health options, their availability makes it difficult for me to keep appointments as I'm either in class or fast asleep."
330,University of Massachusetts-Lowell,"I'm not familiar with services provided by the college.
Overall, mental health needs to be the foremost important thing to be maintained for each student and staff member."
331,University of Minnesota,Info on how to access mental health support on campus should be more readily available and widely discussed. There should also be more resources for getting diagnosis
332,Carnegie Mellon,CAPS does not really work and it somehow worsen the situation. I talk to my academic advisor about my personal issues and she has been really caring
333,Pepperdine University,"There are a lot of surface level mental health initiatives: therapy dogs, free face masks (for spa, not for COVID) offered, etc. Little actual counseling referrals. "
334,University of Arizona,"The programs in place are excellent, but there is a cost that some students are unable to pay. Mental health services should be free or more discounted."
335,University of Washington,"I used the telecounseling over the pandemic, but I wish I could go past my 4 visits with the addition of more staff at UW for therapy"
336,Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University,"The campus needs better psychiatrists, the one I got wanted to increase my dose of medication every time, even if it hadn't worked in the past. "
337,UB, 
338,UPenn,none work in my opinion. CAPS was unable to find me a therapist and my only request was a female therapist. so disappointing and embarrassing or Penn.
339,Amherst,"the college has a lot of services but medical intervention is typically a band aid for other deeply rooted problems. this is not a college-specific issue, however"
340,Barnard,"Yes, but they don't advertise their services well enough and the one time I tried using it they ghosted me so now Im hesitant to go back"
341,UNC,"CAPS is incredibly underfunded and overworks/underpays all its grad student staff, which makes CAPS a very unhelpful and unfriendly resource even though it's pushed all then time."
342,Rowan,"I enjoy the pet therapy program and I believe that works well, I believe the campus needs more long term therapy options and an in office psychiatrist."
343,Southern Methodist University,I started attending teletherapy through SMU during fall 2021. It helped a little at first but I have not been since the beginning of the spring semester.
344,Los Angeles City College,I'm a OSS student thus I do get more additional help from my disability and its has more a help tool and assistance in my college life
345,Oakton Community College,"I am not currently aware of what Oakton offers regarding mental health wellness but I would really appreciate online help or easier classes directed to those who
Struggle."
346,Goshen College,"Since the campus is so small, there’s no on-campus health clinic. All of those needs have to be addressed off-campus at a nearby primary care office."
347,Lewis & Clark College,"I think more things that encourage people with average mental health to participate, as I often feel as though I'm not unwell enough to seek help."
348,UC Berkeley,"I like the service of in-person counseling at the Tang Center, but I wish I was able to get more frequent visits rather than every month"
349,Rowan,"I don’t know, it seems that the community is mad with the ability of the university’s ability to communicate with students have a difficult time "
350,Syracuse,Syracuse does not care much for the mental health of its students who are drowning in debt thanks to the renovation of the CARRIER DOME. 
351,Ohio State,students shouldn't be put on a waitlist for months when they apply for student counseling. there should be enough staff to provide students with immediate help
352,University of Minnesota,I think more accessibility for free therapy sessions would be incredibly helpful. The free online meditation sessions see like a great opportunity and helpful resource. 
353,South Carolina,Therapists are very high quality. There needs to be more of them so patient caseload per provider are not increased but more students can be seen.
354,Stanford,The wellness counseling is spectacular but please give them a raise and expand the staff.  I had to wait a month to get help sometimes.
355,Stony Brook University,"The weekly counselor appointments. Finding the right counselor for a student is important, and I don’t think my student health services has done that effort. "

357,UB,I have no clue for my college but the aspect of mental health and wellness need more attention to people’s surroundings and stuff like that 
358,University of Arizona,I mainly need help with my communication skills as my autism makes it hard for me to reach out and communicate with the world.  
359,Arizona State,Sails department for special needs students and online students are a great asset for ASU and more attention is needed to maintain good standards with them
360,Michigan State University,literally nothing CAPS is full and they ghosted me after saying i could go off campus. i don’t have a car and i can’t do that.
361,Florida State,Need more attention on students who are really struggling mentally and physically; friends have been turned away by counseling because they were unfit to be helped
362,New York University,I haven’t seen anything that works well. It’s often hard to get an appointment with mental health services and counselors are inconsistent and change often. 
363,UB,I like how mental health services are available to us as UB students and my professors remind us that we can utilize them at any time
364,UMich,"There's a 24-hour Counseling service, which is useful. There needs to be more attention towards physical and mental health declining as a result of academic stresses."
365,Rio Salado College,Counseling is honestly really helpful and now you can contact through email and zoom meetings since many of us still fear going out a lot 
366,SOWELA Technical Community College,Telecommunication for mental health is discrete and ran well but could reach out more to the students for those who are nervous to ask for help.
367,Lake Area Technical Institute,We have a lot of focus toward mental health related to school stress but I feel that more focus should be added to general life stress.
368,UB,I was refused mental health counseling on campus because i was not being and abused or risk for my life because they didn’t have enough staff
369,University of Arizona,"The counseling is good but there aren't enough counselors, the college should hire more. Wait times to see a counselor are four weeks right now"
370,UT Austin,mental health resources are good but needs reformment/better staffing/procedures lots of students have had a bad experience that give the resources a bad reputation 
371,Johns Hopkins University,"Nothing really is working well. The counseling center needs more attention, as it turns people away, is generally useless, and is booked months in advance."
372,Stony Brook University,I think allowing students to feel more comfortable by allowing them to bring pets and having events where they can socialize with one another 
373,Purdue University-Main Campus, 
374,Ithaca College,"To my understanding counseling is intended to be short-term and goal based, regularly scheduled consistent therapy counseling is not offered which is an issue. "

376,Arizona State,On campus therapists are hard to make appointments with and lack training required to help students. Teachers are not understanding even when students have accommodations.
377,Haverford College,"CAPS is a joke. They are difficult to get an appointment with, don't prescribe the medications I need, and don't care when I am struggling."
378,Harvard,"I am aware that we have mental health resources, but I am not familiar with how to use them nor what repercussions they may have."

380,Tufts,"I don’t know what is working well, but I think body image anxiety and eating disorders, which I’m having trouble right now, need more attention."

382,Haverford College,"I’ve liked my caps counselor a lot, but I think that the college staff in general should do a better job addressing mental health. "
383,UB,I’m not sure because I do not use any :/ I have heard people find it difficult to get quick appointments (usually a long wait)

385,Virginia,"The online services seem to be helpful from what I’ve heard, but it might be good to have a more diverse staff for it. "
386,West Virginia University,WVU has the Carruth Center that they frequently advertise. I’ve never visited it though so I’m not sure how good of a place it is.
387,University of Arizona,Focus on taking care of yourself has been emphasized. Understanding what happens if you do need to get help and what comes next is lacking.
388,Iowa Central Community College,"I'm not sure about college supported services, but I think the accessibility of therapy for college students is not the best. Coupled with insurance...not great."
389,UCLA,"The CAPS center and Black Bruin Center is working well at UCLA to help support students with resources, activities, and counselors regarding mental health."
390,Oklahoma State,"I have not used any of the campus resources concerning mental health directly, but my academic advisor is a huge help for me personally."

396,Arizona State,N/A
